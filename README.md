# Naive Bayes Classification
## Implementing Machine Learning Algorithm : Naive Bayes Classification on the data-set of Social Network Ads

In machine learning, Naive Bayes Classifier belongs to the category of Probabilistic Classifiers. A probabilistic classifier can predict given observation by using a probability distribution over a set of classes and based on that distribution it will predict the most likely class that the observation should belong to.
Naive Bayes classification is a probabilistic approach to classify the data set based on the famous and well known Bayes Theorem of probability. Key terms in Naive Bayes classification are Prior probability, Posterior Probability, Likelihood probability, and Evidence probability.
While performing Naive Bayes classification, the commonly used Probability distributions are Gaussian distribution, Multinomial Distribution, Bernoulli distribution etc. In this article, we shall be using Gaussian distribution as it can be related to most of the real-time data (as per the central limit theorem if the thing you measure has a lot of (small, independent) causes (or components), the measure will behave like a normal distribution) and it is very easy to implement because we only need mean and standard deviation of the data. We can even call this implementation as Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification
